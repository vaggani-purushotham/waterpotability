# Water Potability Prediction:

This project predicts whether water is potable or not using machine learning models. The dataset includes various water quality indicators such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, and trihalomethanes.


# Dataset:

Source: Kaggle - Water Potability Dataset

Rows: 3,276 samples

Target Column: Potability (1 = Safe to Drink, 0 = Not Safe)


# Workflow:

1.DATA EXPLORATION & VISUALIZATION:

Null values check & handling (median imputation).

Correlation heatmap, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.


2.PREPROCESSING:

Train-test split (70-30).

Standardization using StandardScaler.
